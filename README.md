## Slackr - Webhook Middleware for Slack
---
Middleware to translate incoming POST Webhooks from any service and send the request on to Slack in its accepted format.  

Will also listen on /slack for any outgoing webhooks from Slack and react to those commands as defined in config.json

Pull request, issues and feature requests all welcome.

### Configuration - Incoming Webhooks
The config.json file in the root folder will need to be updated to point to your Incoming Webhooks integration on Slack. Fill in the slack.domain and slack.token fields in config.json to match the integration variables found here: https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook

Listeners can be defined in config.json under the "integrations" array. Define each of your integrations and all of the routes and templates associated with them.

route schema:
* **path** The path to listen for webhooks on. If the integration is called 'github' and the route path is set to '/commits', the service will listen on http://yourserver:port/github/commits
* **channel** The Slack channel to post to
* **template** Path to the handlebars template to translate on
* **emoji _(optional)_** The slack emoji to show in the channel
* **icon _(optional)_** URL to an image to show next to message in channel  
* **username _(optional)_** Name to post this message as in the Slack channel  

The translations are created using the Handlebars templating engine. The template will have access to the incoming JSON object from the service and the results of the translation will be sent to the specified Slack channel. Read more on what Handlebars is capable of here: http://handlebarsjs.com/

### Configuration - Outgoing Webhooks

The 'slack' array in config.json can be used to define modules you want to load in and listen for commands on from Slack. You will need to add an 'Outgoing Webhook' service integration setup in your slack instance with the trigger words you want ('xkcd' to work with the default module in Slackr). Add your Slackr instance to the URL field (http://yourserver:port/slack) and copy the token that gets created into the 'outgoing_webhook_token' config variable.

slack config schema:
* **regex** The regex to match on in order to call the module below
* **module** follows a format of [modulename].[function]
